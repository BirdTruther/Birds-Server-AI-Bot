## What It Does

- **AI chat** — Mention the bot or reply to it. Supports text, image understanding, and image generation via Gemini.
- **Long-term memory** — The AI builds one durable server-wide "fact sheet" (names, mains, inside jokes) and references it across channels; also feeds roasts. Hourly, cost-bounded consolidation, with **pinned facts** that survive AI rewrites.
- **Tarkov** — Item prices, ammo rankings, trader timers, map/boss info, player stats.
- **Tarkov Allergies** — Roleplay allergy tracking; log and compare what members are allergic to.
- **Hate List** — Admin-managed roleplay roast list; the bot tags and roasts listed users with AI-generated lines, unless roast pings are toggled off. Any listed user can self-opt-out with `/hate remove-me`.
- **CS2** — Skin prices, float values, player stats, map callouts, case simulator.
- **Music** — YouTube voice playback via `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg`. No API key required.
- **Twitch** — Connects to Twitch IRC and relays messages to Discord.
- **Dashboard** — Live web UI at `http://localhost:3001` for logs, persona switching, hate list (with a roast-pings toggle), long-term memory management (add/pin/edit/delete facts), and Cultist tracking.
