# Commands

All commands are Discord slash commands. Type `/` in any channel — Discord autocomplete shows them instantly.

Commands are registered **globally** on startup, so one bot instance can serve
multiple Discord servers. Global command changes can take up to an hour to
appear everywhere.

## Tarkov Allergies

Roleplay allergies for the server. Track and "react" to what members are allergic to.

## Hate List

Admin-managed roleplay "hate list". Admins add users, and the bot roasts them: chat reactions tag hated users, and roughly once per hour the bot has a chance to fire an AI-generated roast into the configured channel.

| Command | Description | Args |
|---|---|---|
| `/hate add` | Add a user to the hate list | `user` |
| `/hate remove` | Remove a user from the hate list | `user` |
| `/hate remove-me` | Remove **yourself** from the hate list (self-service, always available) | — |
| `/hate list` | Show all hated users | — |
| `/hate channel` | Set the channel where roasts fire | `channel` |

> `add`, `remove`, `list`, and `channel` are gated by Discord-native slash-command permissions — only admins you grant them to can use those. `/hate remove-me` is intentionally open so any listed player can opt out anytime.
>
> The hate list, roast channel, and "Roast Pings" toggle are separate for each Discord server. Proactive roast pings (the hourly AI timer and random chat callouts) can be disabled from the dashboard; on-demand roasts and reply-based attacks stay active.

---

## Admin

| Command | Description | Args |
